<h2 style="color:blue;">Technologies Used</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
    <strong>ChatConnect</strong> is a full-stack project built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability and reliability. 
    The backend is powered by <strong>Django</strong>, utilizing Django's powerful <strong>ORM</strong> for efficient database management and <strong>REST API</strong> to handle client-server interactions.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
    The project is fully containerized using <strong>Docker</strong> and orchestrated with <strong>Docker Compose</strong> to streamline development and deployment processes. 
    For handling static content and providing a reverse proxy, <strong>NGINX</strong> is used to ensure seamless performance in production.
